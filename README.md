### Project Overview
---

This project was aimed to present a coherent, wholistic and a detailed view of the basic Human resources dashboard which covers the following: 

1. Employee KPI
   
2. Attrition by gender
   
3. Department wise Attrition

4. Number of employees by age

5. Job Satisfaction rating

6. Education  field wise Attrition

7. Attrition rate by gender

   
Furthermore, filters are also made available to enable user percolate variables for effective decision making.

The dashboard below answer the questions in this project which has been discussed unabridgely in subsequent chapters:

### Tools Used
---

The following tools were used in the course of this project:

-Power Point: This was used to designed the background of the dashboard before being exported to tableau.

-Excel: Used for data cleaning and peparation 

-SQL: Used to interact and manipulate data

-Tableau: A lot of calculated fields was created and a "level of detail expressions" in order to prepare the dashboard.

### Data Cleaning and preparation 
---

Data cleaning was done in removing outliers and some irrelevant data which may affect our findings.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---

This project analysis intends to profer answers to the inqueries below and as well recommend actionable step for company growth:

- Show the KPI of all employees with respect their employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employee and average age

- Show the employee attrition by gender

- Show employee attrition by department

- Show the number of employees by age group

- Job Satisfaction rating

- Education field wise attrition

- Attrition rate by gender for different age group.
  
### Results and Findings

### 1. KPI of all employees

![K{I](https://github.com/Timothygbenga/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/assets/154624761/fe3a1e11-09af-4d4e-93d9-0c0b23c6d76c)

From the excerpt above, the company has one thousand four hundred and seventy staff **(1470)** while the staff strenght recently reduced by two hundred and thirty seven **(237)** at sixteen point twelve percent **(16.12%)**, The active employee is one thousand two hundred and thirty three **(1233)** and the average age of staff is thirty seven **(37)**.

### 2. Attrition by gender

![Attrition by gender](https://github.com/Timothygbenga/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/assets/154624761/88bd901c-1667-48e8-8a63-b40fe1e6efc8)

The attrition age is easy to understand.The general overview of attrition by gender revealed that female employees has reduced by eighty seven  **(87)** while the male employees reduced by one hundred and fifty **(150)**.

### 3. Department wise Attrition

![department wise attrition](https://github.com/Timothygbenga/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/assets/154624761/8e2b8a07-151b-4080-9cbe-67d837dd4d8a)

The pie chart shows the three major departments with the highest attrition. Sales recorded thirty eight point eight two **(38.82%)** while Human resources department recorded five point zero six percent. **(5.06%)** Research and development recorded the highest with fifty six point twelve **(56.12%)**. This findings revealed that employees in R&D are unwilling to work with the company for a long time. 


### 4. Number of employees by age group

![Number of employees by age group](https://github.com/Timothygbenga/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/assets/154624761/d5e97c2d-59d0-45c0-b30d-3d0869526eb4)

The x-axis of the bar chart above represents age bracket of employees while the y-axis represents the number of employees (i.e employee count).The highest age bracket of the staff is between thirty one to thirty three **(31-33)** with two hundred and thirteen **(213)** employees while the lowest is between age fifty eight to sixty **(58-60)** with five **(5)** employees. 

Findings revealed that the higher ⏫ the age bracket the lower ⏬ the number of employee. Also, large number of employees falls between age thirty one to thirty three.

### 5. Job Satisfaction rating

![Job satisfaction rating](https://github.com/Timothygbenga/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/assets/154624761/60fd8607-b968-45e5-bb07-80c22654e1b5)

Job role follows the horizontal axis while job Satisfaction follows the vertical axis with total at the end of the each axis.
Job Satisfaction is measured in stars. The higher the number, the higher the satisfaction. One hundred and twelve Sales executives **(112)** was rated four stars ⭐⭐⭐⭐ while  Human resources recorded the least with thirteen **(13)** Stars ⭐⭐⭐. This implies that Sales executives seems to be satisfy with their job while while HR department is needed to encouraged. Also the total number of employees who are rated four ⭐⭐⭐⭐ are  not up to one third of the entire workforce. This implies that employees commitment to work is poor.

### 6 Education field wise attrition 

![education field wise attrition](https://github.com/Timothygbenga/HR-Analytics-Dashboard/assets/154624761/6bb36482-414d-43bd-9848-4ab7c1894294)

This report shows the attitude of employees to training, seminar, and workshop orgaized for staff. Attendance was taken and the report revealed that eighty nine **(89)** employees absconded and uninterested in life sciences courses or training while human resources has the least with seven **(7)** employees.  

### 7. Attrition rate by gender for different age group.

The donor circle is seperated by gender with total at the center. Female gender has the highest age attrition with twenty nine point eleven percent **(29.11%)** between age twenty five to thirty four **(25-34)** while male gender has eighteen point fourteen percent **(18.14%)**. Taking into consideration the five donor circles, we find out that the female gender leaves the company more that the male gender at their productive age. We also discovered  that the more employee grow older the more they leave.


### Recommendations
---

**Employee traning:**


The results of our finding has revealed that HR department is not efficient in the discharge of their duties and this has affected the entire workforce because they have the lowest rating, high attrition rate by department and poor parameters for educating staff.


In order to improve staff performanance and productivity, there should a routing "on the job" training for HR personal and actionable steps must be taken to drive staff sensization. This research work suggests training should be done in the following areas:

- Employee contributions in organizational growth
  
- Relationship between job satisfaction and company's profitablity

  
- Challenges of companies and the role of employee

  
- Employee relationship and work ethics

  
- Diligent and hardwork in a wwork place

  
- Danger of inconsistency in a work place

- Leedership

If this recommendation is considered, it will reduce the attrition rate and improve employee satisfaction rating. Employees will be energize to wwork and deliver without fear of job insecurity. 

### Gender consideration: 

As earlier reavealed in our dashboard, female gender has the highest attrition rate by age group and the male has the highest by gender attrition. This suggests to us that employees are leaving the company at their productive age which may not be good for the company. Hence the company should employ more productive female gender between age eighteen to thirty **(18-30)** to replace the ones that left.


### Adequate monitoring and supervision:

Managers are expected to lead by example but unfortunately this is not true in the job satisfaction dashboard, thirty three **(33)**  out of one hundred and two **(102)** managers were rated four star ⭐⭐⭐⭐. This is not up to one third of the managers in total. The managers and the supervisors are not monitoring the employees.

However, this project wwork suggests that their should be an "online realtime" performance review and this should involve the following paramaters, using sales manager as case study:

-Number of customers reached

-Number of customers visited and calls

-Number of customer acquired with respect to weekly and monthly target

-Weekly and monthly performance report

In addition to above, there should also be a reward sytem to encourage the best sales representatives.


This recommendation will drive sales, increase client database and profit of the company.
