### Data Cleaning and preparation 
Data cleaning was done in removing outliers and some irrelevant data that may affect our findings.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

- Show the KPI of all employees with respect their employee count, attrition count, attrition rate, active employee and average age

- Show the employee attrition by gender

- Show employee attrition by department

- Show the number of employees by age group

- Job Satisfaction rating
